Step 1: Get PHP installed
__________________________

Navigate to php.net
Click on downloads
Click on windows
Download the thread-safe zip file for the appropriate package [64-bit in my case]
Navigate to folder in which zip file downloaded
Right click and select "Extract all" and extact these files to C:\php [you are creating the php folder by typing in that destination]

In search bar type "environment" and "edit the system environment variables" will show up - select it.
click on "environment variables" under Advanced
Double click "path" from User variables list [first list]
add "C:\php" to the list and hit Okay, hit Okay again, and one more time to close out of all windows 

Open command line by searching for CMD or command in your search window
type "echo %path%" and hit enter
make sure your C:\php shows up in the paragraph of path locations

type "php -v" and hit enter
The computer should return the version of PHP you're using. 
NOTE: If it tells you the version is incompatible with your computer for any reason, then delete the php folder you created and saved the php files to, go back to the beginning of this process and then install an earlier version of php. That should fix the problem.

Step 2: Starting a Server 
_________________________

Example file location: documents/repos/form/email-sign-up-php/site.php
cd to where you'd like to start a server running to serve up any php files you'll be working on --
Example: cd documents/repos
Type: "php -S localhost:4000" to start the server
In your browser open a new tab, type localhost:4000/*your/filepath/yourphpfile*.php 
*replace this with your path info*
Example: localhost:4000/form/email-sign-up-php/site.php
Note that the "form" folder is inside the folder where I cd'd into in order to start the server. 

Important: Keep the terminal window open the entire time you need the server running. 









php -S localhost:4000
